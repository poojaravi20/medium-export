                    This is a test HTML page that you can import to Medium as 
                    a template to backdate your post.

                    You'll know when you've successfully backdated your post
                    by looking at the bottom of your article when you import
                    to Medium: it should say something like: "Originally 
                    published at *** on [Whatever your date is]."
